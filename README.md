# Chess LM

<!-- **[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mJzDxWEfNcnNPRPQUBFh-fCAaaVKV26Y?usp=sharing)** -->

A transformer fit to chess data to see if it performs better than most of players. To get the data run the scrip `download.py` as follows:
```
# downloads the data from the list of links
python3 download.py -d # will take 20-30 mins depending on internet speed

# parses the data and starts storing information in text files
python3 download.py -p # will take few hours

# legacy
python3 download.py -v # prints the meta

Found 472 files.

There are few improvements to be done if you are interested:

1. Introduce `multiprocessing` in the `download.py` to speed up the process, it was not needed in my case since I ran the code overnight on my laptop.
2. Speed up downloads by using `FTP` scripts instead of `HTTP` used by `requests` package.


I am currently training a model on colab that has the configuration given in [`config.json`](config.json). This takes about 13 mins to go through one epoch, I am using train/finetune concept that seemlessly trains or finetunes an existting model (super useful when using colab).

## What's the metric?

So a natural question is how are the comparisons and testing done. Well there are a few things to compare here:

### ELO Rating

How good is a particular agent? When comparing chess players [ELO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) is the mtetric used. So this will give us the comparisons not only with humans but between different players as well. For eg. we can compare between LSTM-network vs Transformer or Distilled Models vs Full models.

### Model

So after all the parsing and all, I compressed the file using a standard compressor on macOS and ~1.1GB of files was compressed to ~360MB, which maens that if my model is bigger than ~1.1GB, we cannot say it has learned something just that it has stored all the information in it's weights. If however the model size is smaller than ~360MB, model would have learned to go through compressed data. So this is a unique metric to look at.

Eg. GPT-2 big was ~1.75Bn Parameters trained on 40GB of uncompressed text, even if I assume ~20 GB after standard compression (would have been more than this), the model still learned a lookup table through the compressed data.

**Update 09.08.2020:** The model I am training on Colab has the following configurations (`211040 * 32 bits = 844160 Bytes` or `0.85KB` model which is `<< 360MB`):

I scraped the links from [pgnmentor.com](https://www.pgnmentor.com/files.html) and the games are by the players. I am not aware of the legality here, so if you have an problem, just raise an issue with the appropriate tag.
