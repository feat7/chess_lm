        Game is considered draw in the following cases:

        - Threefold repetition rule: an identical position has occured in last three moves
            (player has to ask the arbiter to declare draw or mutually agree)
        - Fifty-move rule: if in the previous 50 moves by ecah side, no pawn has moved and no
            capture has been made (player has to ask the arbiter to declare draw or mutually agree)
        - Fivefold repetition: an identical position has occured in last five moves (auto-draw)
